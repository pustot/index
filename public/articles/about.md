# My Name

My surname is 杨 (Yáng) and my given name is 晨曦 (Chénxī), romanized with Pinyin (ISO 7098).

My name was designed originally for my two mother tongues, one is a kind of Central Plains Mandarin, another is 
Putonghua (Modern Standard Mandarin Chinese). It is pronounced /jɑ̃⁵³. t͡ʂʰә̃ ⁵³. ɕi²¹³/ and /jɑŋ³⁵. t͡ʂʰən³⁵. ɕi⁵⁵/, respectively. For them, the only difference in the pronunciation of my name happened to
be almost only in the tone values (but the tone classes are the same: yángpíng, yángpíng and yīnpíng).

In other varieties of Chinese language, I would prefer it be pronounced as Chinese names are supposed to be. For example, /jä̃³¹ t͡ʂʰɐn³¹ ɕi⁴⁴/ in Kunming Southwestern Mandarin, /jœ:ŋ²¹ sɐn²¹ hei⁵⁵/ (Joeng⁴ San⁴hei¹) in Yuehai Cantonese, /ɦiã¹¹³ zən¹¹³⁻²² ɕi⁵³⁻⁴⁴/ in Shanghai Wu Chinese (Shanghainese), /iũ²⁴ sin²⁴ hi⁵⁵/ (Iûnn Sîn-hi) in Hokkien.

In languages that have Sino-Xenic pronunciation systems, I would prefer Sino-Xenic pronunciations. For example, 楊（よう）晨曦（しんぎ） (Yō Shingi) in Japanese, 양신희 (Yang Sin-hui) in Korean, Dương Thần Hi in Vietnamese.

In other languages, we could use an imitation of the Putonghua sound, Yang Chenxi.

By the way, my English name is Ethan if you prefer the English name. 
I chose the English name mostly because E-Than-Yang sounds like Xi-Chen-Yang and Hei-San-Yeung,
which are Mandarin and Cantonese pronunciations of my Chinese name reversed.

# The Domain Name

The name `yangchnx` is formed by removing all vowel letters from my given name.

# An Alternative Domain Name

The alternative domain name "yangcxyo" consists of my surname Yang (楊), the abbreviation of my given name Chen-xi 
(Chen (晨) and Xi (曦) are two characters), and "yo".
It is chosen firstly because the names "yang", "yangcx", "cxyang", 
"chenxiyang", "yangchenxi", "ethanyang" are all taken, and I had to add some thing to my most preferred 
domain names.
The additional "yo" can be first understood as cool greetings to all of you coming to my website.
It means "I" in Spanish.
It is also related to my surname, 楊. In Japanese, 楊 is pronounced exactly as Yō (よう), and since Japanese 
is my third language and I enjoyed the time when I did my minor degree in Japanese and called Yō-sensei 
(not in the strict meaning), it is worthwhile add this part in memory. Besides, 楊 is pronounced in many 
languages (Sino-Xenic pronunciations) and dialects in different but interrelated ways, for what Yang and Yo are very representative:
most of them have a semivowel or an approximant consonant at beginning, with a main vowel somewhat open and back, 
and a nasal element that could be implemented with a back nasal consonant in the end, or nasalization
of the main vowel, or just lost in history. Examples are /iaŋ/ in Putonghua (杨, yáng) and many other Northern variants of 
Mandarin Chinese, /jaŋ/ (양) in Korean,
/jɨɐŋ/ (reconstructed) in Guangyun (廣韻, Middle Chinese), /iã/ in some Southwestern Mandarin, /ɦiã/ in Shanghai Wu Chinese,
/ɦi/ in Wenzhou Wu Chinese, /jœŋ/ in Canton and Hong Kong Cantonese, /iũ/, /tsʰiũ/ or /iɔŋ/ in many variants of Hokkien,
/iẽ/ or /iaŋ/ in Teochew, /ioŋ/ in Meizhou Hakka, /ʝa/ in Hmong, /jaɴ/ (ရန်) in Burmese,
/joː/ (よう) (historically /jau/ (やう)) in Japanese, /zɨəŋ/ (Dương) in Vietnam, etc. Yang and Yo reflect 
the most important similarities of most of the variants, especially their romanizations, and yo is one of the 
shortest ones that is easy to use in my domain name, so it is selected.
